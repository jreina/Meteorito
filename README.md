# Meteorito
Reactive burrito ordering system built in [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor).

Uses [aldeed/autoform](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform) to generate a form from a complex schema.  
The schema is defined using [aldeed/simpleschema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema).  
Additionally, this uses [twbs/bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) for styling, glyphs, and collapsing functionality as found on the /orders page.
For routing, we are using [kadirahq/flow-router](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router).  
Also using [tholman/github-corners](https://github.com/tholman/github-corners) for the corner banner.
